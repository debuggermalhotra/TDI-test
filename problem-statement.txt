We emphasize project work (rather than brain teasers) in our interview
process
2.

We want to guide you through learning something in this process, as we
learn about you.

This challenge is meant to test your ability to pick up technologies you
haven’t necessarily played around with before and integrate them with
familiar skills into a cohesive system.

1.

A basic (tested) Flask app (or Django if you prefer).
1.

Write a very simple Flask/Django app which accepts a photo upload via
a form, and then displays that photo back to the user. You do not need to
save the uploaded file, simply send it back as the response. Example
app here <https://pacific-atoll-2556.herokuapp.com/> (it’s a Heroku
link so it may take a second to startup).
2.

Write a test for this app which checks that a POST request to the
upload route correctly returns the uploaded photo as the
response body. If
using flask, you may find the flask docs
<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/testing/> helpful here.
3.

Push everything to a public github repo.
2.

Continuous Integration testing for this app
1.

For this step, your task is to set up public CI for your public repo
which runs the above test whenever a new commit to master is pushed on
github. We recommend Travis <https://travis-ci.org/> but here’s a
list of other free CI tools <http://u/>.
2.

Optional bonus points: Autodeploy to a (free) heroku app on a passing
build.
3.

Optional bonus points: Getting a “Build passing” badge on your github
repo that’s updated from your CI.

Once you’ve completed the above, send an email with

1.

Your public github link
2.

Your heroku instance
3.

Your CI instance
4.

A few availabilities for an interview and we’ll speak!
